# Port Disruption Database

This folder includes the dataset and figures used in the paper 'Port disruptions due to climate extremes: insights into port and network level resilience' submitted to 'Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment'. 

The file 'Port-disruption-database.xlsx contains the database which includes: 

-Event + port description: The event, the country, the name of the port, the year and date. 

-Impact: The number of days of reduction, shutdown and recovery, together forming the total number of affected days (TAD). 

-Severity: The severity indicates whether it has a 0-40% impact (1), 40-80% (2) or 80%-100% impact to the normal operations. Ports that do not show a significant impact or where it is hard to distinguish from the time series are given (0).
